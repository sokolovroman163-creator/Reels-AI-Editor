# File-based GPU effects

All effect presets are GPU packages under `effects/` (`backend: "gpu"`). Preview and export share `FrameCompositor` → `EffectProcessor` → `GpuEffectExecutor`.

## effect.json

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` / `displayName` / `category` / `order` | Catalog metadata |
| `thumbnail` | Optional image path (relative to package, or absolute). Defaults to `thumbnail.png` when that file exists |
| `backend` | `"gpu"` or `"model3d"` |
| `parameters[]` | User-facing uniforms — see the parameter types below |
| `fixedParams` | Hidden uniforms (colors as `#rrggbb`, enums as strings) |
| `requires` | `"face"` to receive the baked face anchors, `"depth"` to receive the clip's depth map (see below), or an array of both. Any other value is a parse error. `"depth"` is `gpu` backend only |
| `pipeline` | `intermediateBuffers` + `passes` |

### Parameter types

| `type` | Binds as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `float` (default) | `float` | `minValue`/`maxValue`/`defaultValue`; keyframable |
| `bool` / `boolean` | `float` (0 or 1) | Rendered as a switch; keyframable (the value rounds at 0.5) |
| `color` / `colour` | `vec3`, or `vec4` with `"alpha": true` | `defaultValue` is a `"#rrggbb"` string, or `"#rrggbbaa"` with `alpha`; rendered as a swatch (plus an opacity slider); keyframable |
| `point` / `vec2` | `vec2` | `defaultValue` is `[x, y]`; `minValue`/`maxValue` are `[lo, lo]`/`[hi, hi]` (one shared range); a 2D pad; keyframable per axis |
| `choice` / `enum` | `float` (option index) | `options[]` (at least two); rendered as a dropdown |
| `int` / `integer` | `float` (rounded) | `minValue`/`maxValue`/`defaultValue`; the slider snaps to whole numbers; keyframable. A `float` may also set `step` (or `ui.step`) to snap |
| `file` | *(not bound)* | Absolute path string; `fileFilters` for the picker. Used by `model3d` |

A colour parameter may list `"swatches": ["#rrggbb", …]`, preset shades the inspector shows as a
grid under the picker, and `"enables": "<bool key>"`, a bool parameter that picking any colour
switches on in the same undo step (Face Retouch's Lip colour turns on Custom lip colour). An
invalid swatch, or `enables` naming anything but a bool parameter, is a parse error.

A float parameter named `faceIndex` on a face effect is shown as numbered face buttons rather than
a slider, one per face slot the clip's track uses.

Any parameter may set `group` to fold into a named inspector section. Only the first group starts
open; `"groupCollapsed": true` on a group's parameters keeps it folded even when it comes first
(Face Retouch's Advanced section).

Colour parameters bind as **`vec3`** unless they declare `"alpha": true`, which makes them a
**`vec4`** and adds an opacity slider. Without `alpha`, any alpha in `defaultValue` is discarded at
parse time and the value is normalized to `#rrggbb`; with it, the value is kept as `#rrggbbaa`
(CSS order, alpha last). A colour keyframes as four channel tracks, `<key>.r/.g/.b/.a` in 0..1,
folded back into the hex before binding. File paths are **not keyframable**.

Pass inputs: `source_texture` (+ optional `index`), `buffer` (+ `id`), or `texture` (+ `id`). Multiple inputs bind as `u_currentTexture` (unit 0) and `u_texture1`…  
Pass outputs: `buffer` or `canvas`.

`pipeline.textures[]` declares static image assets loaded once from the package dir:

```json
"textures": [{ "id": "glyphs", "file": "glyphs.png" }]
```

Static textures upload unflipped and **wrap** (`GL_REPEAT`), without mipmaps. A shader that must
not tile one — a makeup template — has to zero it outside [0, 1] itself.

Bundled packages ride inside the Android binary as Qt resources, and only files matching the glob
in `CMakeLists.txt` (`effect.json`, `*.frag`, `*.png`, `*.bin`, `NOTICE`, `LICENSE*`) make it in.
A texture in any other format loads on desktop and fails the package on Android.

### Mesh passes (`"geometry": "face111"`)

A pass may set `"geometry": "face111"` with `"templateBounds": [x, y, w, h]`. Instead of a
full-screen quad, the engine copies the pass's input 0 into its output, then draws GPUPixel's
111-point face mesh over it: each vertex sits on the tracked point from `u_faceLandmarks111`, and
carries the same point on GPUPixel's reference face. The fragment shader gets:

| Varying | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `v_texCoord` | Screen uv, exactly what a quad pass sees at that pixel |
| `v_templateCoord` | uv in the template image. `templateBounds` is where the image sits on the reference face, in its 1280-pixel frame |

`u_templateBounds` and `u_meshAspect` are engine-bound. Outside the mesh, and in the whole frame
when the clip has no mesh, the output is the plain copy. Rules, all enforced at load time:

- `"requires": "face"` effects only — not transitions.
- Input 0 must be a `source_texture` or `buffer` (it is what gets copied).
- `templateBounds` needs four numbers with a positive width and height.

See `effects/face_retouch` for lipstick and blush templates drawn this way, and
`src/engine/Face111.h` for the point order.

## GLSL

- `#version 330 core`
- Reserved: `u_currentTexture`, `u_textureN`, `u_resolution`, `u_time`, `u_timeUs`, `u_frameIndex`, `u_progress`, `u_fromTexture`, `u_toTexture`, `u_depth*`, `u_hasDepth`, `u_templateBounds`, `u_meshAspect`, `u_face*`

**Grace mode:** compile/GL failure → passthrough.

## Face effects

A package with `"requires": "face"` receives the clip's baked landmarks. It should also declare a
`faceIndex` float 0–3, which selects which tracked person to follow — the engine **consumes** that
parameter rather than binding it.

Two coordinate conventions are in play, and mixing them up produces elliptical warps:

- **Positions** (`u_faceLeftEyeX`, …) are in **uv**: 0–1, top-left origin.
- **Lengths, angles and every contour loop** are **width-normalized**: uv with y scaled by the frame
  aspect, so a radius means the same thing along both axes. Rebuild that space from `u_resolution`
  with `vec2 toLocal(vec2 uv, float aspect) { return vec2(uv.x, uv.y * aspect); }`.

### Uniforms

| Uniform | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `u_faceValid` | `float` | **`< 0.5` means pass the frame through untouched.** Every face shader must honour this |
| `u_faceLeftEye`/`RightEye`/`Nose`/`Mouth`/`MouthLeft`/`MouthRight`/`Chin`/`Forehead`/`Center` `X`,`Y` | `float` | uv. Left/right are **image**-side, not the subject's |
| `u_faceRx`, `u_faceRy`, `u_faceAngle`, `u_faceEyeRadius` | `float` | Face oval half-axes, eye-line tilt, iris radius |
| `u_faceHasContours` | `float` | 0 for a sidecar baked before contours existed. Treat like `u_faceValid` |
| `u_faceOval[36]`, `u_faceLipOuter[20]`, `u_faceLipInner[20]`, `u_faceEyeLeft[16]`, `u_faceEyeRight[16]`, `u_faceBrowLeft[10]`, `u_faceBrowRight[10]` | `vec2[]` | Closed loops. Eye rings run inner corner → **upper** lid → outer corner, so indices 0–8 are the lash line |
| `u_faceCheekLeftX/Y`, `u_faceCheekRightX/Y` | `float` | uv |
| `u_facePoseValid` | `float` | 0 when the pose could not be derived |
| `u_facePoseRight`/`Up`/`Fwd` `X`,`Y`,`Z` | `float` | Orthonormal head basis. `Fwd` points **out of the face toward the viewer** |
| `u_facePoseOriginX/Y/Z`, `u_facePoseScale` | `float` | Eye midpoint and interocular distance |
| `u_faceYaw`, `u_facePitch`, `u_faceRoll` | `float` | Radians, derived from the basis for shaders that only want an angle |
| `u_faceHasMesh` | `float` | 0 for a sidecar baked before the mesh existed |
| `u_faceLandmarks111[111]` | `vec2[]` | Width-normalized. The 468-point mesh reduced to GPUPixel's 111-point layout (`src/engine/Face111.h`). Only set when `u_faceHasMesh` is 1 |

Both `u_faceValid` and `u_faceHasContours` must be checked by anything using the loops:

```glsl
if (u_faceValid < 0.5 || u_faceHasContours < 0.5) { fragColor = texture(u_currentTexture, v_texCoord); return; }
```

**Uniform budget.** The seven loops together are 256 components. GL 3.3 core guarantees at least
1024 fragment default-block components, and no shipping package declares more than about 220 — but
this is why the full 468-point mesh is not delivered this way. `u_faceLandmarks111` is 222
components, but many drivers give every array element its own vec4 slot, so count it as 444 and do
not declare it in the same pass as the seven loops. Face Retouch keeps them in separate passes.

**No `#include`.** The package loader materializes each `.frag` verbatim. The polygon SDF helper is
duplicated into every beauty package on purpose, which is also what keeps a package self-contained
enough to redistribute as an addon. If that becomes a burden, the fix is an `"includes"` array
concatenated at parse time in `loadGpuPipeline` — the program cache keys off the materialized
source, so `GlRuntime` would need no change.

**Sidecar compatibility.** Face tracks are format v2; v1 files still load, with `hasContours`,
`hasPose`, and `hasMesh` false. Optional v2 blobs: `"c"` (contours), `"p"` (pose), `"m"` (468×3
mesh, uint16 packed like contours). Missing `"m"` is not an error — the 3D Face Mesh effect
pass-throughs until the clip is re-detected. Format version stays 2; do not bump for the mesh blob.

## Depth effects

A package with `"requires": "depth"` receives the depth estimated for its clip (the Depth addon,
Video Depth Anything; see `VdaDepth` and `DepthSidecar`). The engine compiles a prelude into every
pass — **do not declare these yourself**:

| Name | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `u_depthTexture` | `sampler2D` | Single channel, bound on unit 8. Lower resolution than the frame (short side 392 or 518) |
| `u_depthResolution` | `vec2` | Its size in texels |
| `u_hasDepth` | `float` | **`< 0.5` means there is no depth: pass the frame through.** A clip that has not been estimated, and standalone adjustment tracks, render this way |
| `float driftDepth(vec2 uv)` | helper | 0 is the farthest thing in the clip, 1 the nearest. Normalised over the **whole clip**, so a value means the same place from frame to frame |
| `float driftDepthGuided(vec2 uv, sampler2D guide)` | helper | `driftDepth` snapped to the colour edges of `guide` (normally `u_currentTexture`) by a 3×3 joint-bilateral filter. Use it wherever a depth edge meets a visible edge |
| `vec3 driftNormal(vec2 uv, float strength)` | helper | Surface normal from depth gradients, in uv space (x right, **y down**) with z toward the viewer |
| `vec2 packDepth(float)` / `float unpackDepth(vec2)` | helpers | 16-bit depth through two 8-bit channels of an intermediate buffer |

Depth uv matches the frame's: `(0, 0)` is the top-left. The map is relative, not metres — distances
in a shader are perceptual, so expose a scale parameter rather than assuming units.

### Behind Subject (`depth.occlude`)

A compositor-backend package, not a shader: it places the layer carrying it (text, a sticker, a 3D
model) at `depth` inside a video or image clip beneath it, and wherever that clip is nearer the
layer gives way. Its `target` parameter is of type `clip` (a clip id, picked in the inspector from
`AppController::effectClipCandidates`); empty, or naming a clip that no longer exists, means the
nearest video or image clip beneath — whether or not it has depth yet, so the inspector can name it
and offer to estimate it. A chosen clip that is not on screen at that instant occludes nothing. `FrameCompositor::buildGpuScene` marks the occluder
(`GpuLayer::emitDepthCanvas`) and the occluded layer (`occluderItem`); `composeOnGlThread` lays the
occluder's depth out on a canvas-sized target once it is drawn (`kDepthPlaceFragShader`: depth in
r/g, cutout matte in b, coverage in a), and both layer shaders test against it. With
`cutoutEdges`, an occluder with a single media mask (a Subject/People Cutout matte) supplies the
silhouette and depth only decides in front or behind. The occluder is looked for within the same
scene, so inside a composite clip it stays inside it. Not applied in transitions or the CPU
compositor, and a 3D model counts as one flat plane at `depth`.

## Special case: time_echo

History frames are still decoded in `FrameCompositor`; blending runs on the GPU via `GpuEffectExecutor::blendTimeEcho` (CPU fallback if GL is unavailable).

## 3D face mesh (`backend: "model3d"`)

Not a fragment pipeline — there is no `.frag`. `face_mesh_3d` declares parameters only; the engine
warps the rest-pose Surrey Face Model (`sfm_face.bin`) onto the baked 468-point track and composites
it over the frame.

- Orthographic MVP from `(faceCenter, faceRx, pose, user params, aspect)` — never a pixel size, so
  preview at `renderScale 0.5` and export at 1.0 produce a bit-identical matrix. Depth maps as
  `z_ndc = −z_wn / 4` so `+forward` (toward the viewer) is nearer in the GL depth buffer.
- Lighting is **screen-space** (fixed relative to the frame) and approximate Blinn-Phong in sRGB —
  the rest of the compositor is untagged 8-bit, so linearizing the mesh alone would look foreign.
- Translucent fill plus a barycentric wireframe (`fillOpacity` / `wireframe` / `wireColor` /
  `wireWidth`). Fill+wire uses a geometry shader.
- `warpMesh` is a fixed param. The overlay writes depth (clip-z flipped so MediaPipe nearer-is-smaller
  wins `GL_LESS`; no in-buffer blend) so the nearest surface wins. Draw is two-sided: a real frontal
  pose has `forward.z < 0` (half-turn about X), which reverses winding versus an identity quaternion,
  and `GL_BACK` would cull the whole face. Without `hasMesh`, the effect skips.
- Failure mode: skip the effect, keep the frame. Empty rest-mesh path is silent.
