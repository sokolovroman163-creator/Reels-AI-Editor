// header only reads them, so there is one place to change the service.
//
// The token is NOT a secret and is not treated as one: it ships inside every copy of Drift and
// anyone can pull it out of the binary. Its job is to stop the bucket being crawled or hotlinked,
// which would cost us operations for someone else's benefit. Rotate it by deploying a new Worker
// secret and shipping a new build; old builds then fall back to whatever they have installed.

// A translation unit built outside the `drift` target gets no service rather than a stale
// hardcoded one.
