// Rolling playback counters, sampled as frames are composited and presented.
//
// These exist because "the preview stutters" has at least four unrelated causes in this
// pipeline, and a frame rate alone cannot tell them apart. The two that matter most are
// jitterMs (spread of the delivery interval) and deliveredFps against displayedFps: a
// throughput deficit shows up as both rates falling together, while a cadence problem shows
// up as a healthy delivered rate that the display never gets to show evenly.
//
// Everything is written from the GUI thread — composites report in on completion, presents
// come from the render loop's frameSwapped — so no locking is needed. Nothing here
// allocates on the hot path; the change signal is coalesced onto a timer so QML bindings do
// not re-evaluate per frame.
